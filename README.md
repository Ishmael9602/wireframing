# Introduction to Wireframing  

**What is Wireframing?**  
Wireframing is a **blueprint** of a website or application that focuses on structure and layout without design details like colors or images. It helps designers and developers visualize the interface and user flow early in the process.

**Importance of Wireframing**  
- **Clarifies Ideas** – Helps translate abstract concepts into tangible designs.
- **Facilitates Communication** – Ensures designers, developers, and stakeholders are aligned.
- **Identifies Usability Issues** – Focuses on user experience before styling.
- **Saves Time & Resources** – Prevents costly design revisions.
- **Guides Development** – Acts as a foundation for later design and coding phases.
